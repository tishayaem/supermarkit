# SuperMarkIt

Welcome to the markdown revolution: SuperMarkIt is a lightweight online notepad that uses the awesome power of markdown to declutter your writing experience. A good notepad is like removable storage for the brain!

üöß This is a work in progress, please bear üêª with us while we clean a few things up! üöß

## Objectives

We built this MEAN stack app as our final project at [Makers Academy](www.makersacademy.com) to combine the awesome power of Evernote and OneNote with the simplicity of writing apps like iA Writer and Day One. Our objectives were to:
* build a functioning web app from scratch
* explore the mean, lean power of Mongo, Express.js, AngularJS and Node.js
* level-up our agile skills using TDD, pair-programming, GitHub + Waffle.io and regular stand-ups and retros
* build something beautiful

To run test commands, you will need to globally install grunt-cli and nodemon if you haven't already:
* `npm install -g grunt-cli`
* `npm install -g nodemon`

For front-end changes:
* `grunt sass`

#### Run

* `npm install -g node-mongo-seeds` install node-mongo-seeds to seed the database
* `npm run start-dev` and navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

#### Test

Front-end unit tests:

Back-end unit tests:
* `npm run test-mocha`

End-to-end testing: (run the following in separate terminal panes)
```sh
$ webdriver-manager start
# in separate terminal pane
$ npm run start-test
# in separate terminal pane
$ npm run test-protractor
```
To run the entire suite, ensure you have `webdriver-manager` and the `test` server running in the background as above, and run `npm run test-everything`
